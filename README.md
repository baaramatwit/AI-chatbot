Chatbot using Natural Language Processing

This is a chatbot for Matt young Media, he is a virtual assistant for them working 24/7 answering questions for potential clients at a rapid speed and high accuracy. 

Here are the 4 steps I took to build this chatbot : 

1.) Understanding theory + Natural Language Processings concepts (stemming, tokenization, bag of words) 
2.) Create training data 
3.) Pytorch model and training 
4.) Save and load the model and implement the chat bot
