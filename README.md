This is a chatbot for Matt young Media his name is NueroLine, NueroLine is a virtual assistant for them working 24/7 answering questions for potential clients at a rapid speed and high accuracy. 

NueroLine knows how to greet customers, say goodbye, tell customers his name, his hours of operation, the service Matt Young Media provide, and build trust with customers by providing testomonials from https://www.mattyoungmedia.com/


Here are the 4 steps I took to build this chatbot : 

1.) Understanding theory + Natural Language Processings concepts (stemming, tokenization, bag of words) 
2.) Create training data 
3.) Pytorch model and training 
4.) Save and load the model and implement the chat bot
